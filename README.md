# Cat Clicker Premium

Project of [Frond-End Developer Nanodegree](https://br.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001-br-advanced) program from @Udacity

**About the application:**
```
Visual

The app should display
-a list of at least 5 cats listed by name
-an area to display the selected cat

In the cat's display area, it should appear
-the cat's name
-a cat photo
-text showing the number of clicks

Interaction
-When a cat's name is displayed in the list, the cat's display area should be displayed to show the selected cat's data.
-The number of clicks in the cat area should be unique to each cat, and should be incremented when a cat photo is clicked.

Was implemented an admin button that allows the user to change the cats' information. The JavaScript is also now organized within a MVC (Model, View, Controller) architecture.

The variables and functions within the model and view objects communicate with each other via the "octopus" object. The "octopus" object is the controller in the MVC architecture.

Begin:
